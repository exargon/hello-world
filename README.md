Yet another hello to the world

One rather chilly evening in early spring, a figure entangled in strands of a seemingly natural but yet mystical origin sat down by a dimensional window. A window into what used to be the past and the future, but was now the present. 

Through this shimmering mirror of time a communication was seeing its initiation trial. A mere monolog at this point, the communication was both excited and worried about what would come. This was not the first, or would it be the last, time it had gone through a sermony like this. Some hold the trials of the monolog to be the worst, and many monologs die before even hearing the echo of a dialog. But the monolog knows. He knows that when you reach the status of dialog, that's when everything balances on the edge of a serif.

The communication fades into the abyss of time as the figure rises up and abondends the echo of the whispering newborn.
