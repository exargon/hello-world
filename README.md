Yet another hello to the world

One rather chilly evening in early spring, a figure entangled in strands of a seemingly natural but yet mystical origin sat down by a dimensional window. A window into what used to be the past and the future, but was now the present. 

Through this shimmering mirror of time a communication was seeing it's trial of initiation. A mere monolog at this point the communication was excited but also worried about what would come. This was not the first, or would it be the last time it had gone through a sermony like this. Some hold the trials for monolog the worst, as the way to the dialog is already half trodden when you get there. But the monolog knows. He knows that when you reach the rank of dialog, that's when everything balances on the edge of a serif.

The communication fades into the abyss of time as the figure rises up and abondends the whispiring echo of the newborn child.
